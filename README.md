# Deferred asset loader

# Trivia
There are several heavy-weight resources that could be used right after **fully loaded,** for instance, short videos.
This mechanism allows:

- preload all these assets in handy way;
- provide the usual UX (kind of _Loading..._ image until al the assets are not loaded).

# Usage
The code is commented well.
